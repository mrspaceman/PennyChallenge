# Starling Round-Up feature

Looking through the API documentation at [Starling Developers](https://developer.starlingbank.com/), we can see that to
round up transactions we need to call the **"Get Transactions Between"**
endpoint (`/api/v2/feed/account/{accountUid}/category/{categoryUid}/transactions-between`). This will return all of the
transactions between the given two dates. we can then iterate through them and calulcate the round up amount for those
transactions.

This endpoint needs the following parameters:

1. `accountUid`: To get this we need to call the **"Get Accounts"** endpoint (`/api/v2/accounts`) as the `accountUid`
   field
2. `categoryUid`: This is also returned by the **"Get Accounts"** endpoint (`/api/v2/accounts`) as the `defaultCategory`
   field
3. `startDate`: This needs to get specified by the user
4. `endDate`: This needs to get specified by the user

We will also need to call the **"Add money into a savings goal"**
endpoint (`/api/v2/account/{accountUid}/savings-goals/{savingsGoalUid}/add-money/{transferUid}`)

This endpoint needs the following parameters:

1. `accountUid`: To get this we need to call the **"Get Accounts"** endpoint (`/api/v2/accounts`) as the `accountUid`
   field
2. `savingsGoalUid`: This is also returned by the **"Get Accounts"** endpoint (`/api/v2/accounts`) as the
   `savingsGoalUid` field
3. `transferUid`: This is a unique uuid that is generated by us and can be used to identify the transfer transaction.

We can see from this that we need to get the Savings goal Uid, which we can get

## Steps

To perform round ups on transactions between two dates we need to perform the following steps:

1. Get the start and end dates from the user.
2. Call the **"Get Accounts"** endpoint (`/api/v2/accounts`).
3. Get the dates that we want to use.
    * This can be done by getting the user to enter the dates into date pickers.
4. Call the **"Get Transactions Between"**
   endpoint (`/api/v2/feed/account/{accountUid}/category/{categoryUid}/transactions-between`).
5. go through the list of transactions and round up the amounts.
