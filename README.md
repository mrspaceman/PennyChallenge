# Starling Account 1p Savings Challenge

Inspired by the [365 Day 1p Challenge 2021](https://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/discussion/6229222/365-day-1p-challenge-2021)
I decided to setup a savings goal in my [Starling Account](https://www.starlingbank.com/)
 and get going.

 I heard that [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) have a [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/applets/GutUrxFv-take-on-the-1p-savings-challenge) module that automates the savings for you, and I thought that would be great.

But, Starling dont have a IFTTT plugin to automate the savings :(.
